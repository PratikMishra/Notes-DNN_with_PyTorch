# Notes-on-course---Deep-Neural-Networks-with-PyTorch
These are self-made notes on the course "Deep Neural Networks with PyTorch" under specialization "IBM AI Engineering". <br>
The notes are embedded within the jupyter notebooks along with the corresponding pytorch code. I found this was the most efficient way to have both the theoretical and practical part at a single place.
